5. Rich Color Schemes and Aesthetic Tones: Magical Evening in Venice

The sky above is filled with softly swirling colors — blues, pinks, and purples — merging together. The entire scene feels both familiar and otherworldly, blurring the line between reality and imagination. Soft colors, ambient lighting, and a tranquil, abstract style."
